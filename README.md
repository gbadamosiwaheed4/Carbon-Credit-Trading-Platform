# Decentralized Carbon Credit Trading Platform

A blockchain-based marketplace for transparent, efficient, and verifiable carbon credit trading to combat climate change.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) revolutionizes carbon credit markets by providing a transparent, efficient trading platform that connects carbon credit generators with buyers. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures immutability, traceability, and verification of carbon credits while eliminating intermediaries and reducing market friction.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Carbon Credit Issuance Contract:** Creates and verifies carbon credits
    - Standardizes carbon credit units and certification
    - Implements verification logic for valid carbon offsets
    - Creates tokenized carbon credits as NFTs with metadata
    - Maintains registry of certified credit issuers

2. **Trading Contract:** Facilitates buying and selling of carbon credits
    - Manages order book and matching engine
    - Enables spot and futures trading
    - Supports both fixed price and auction mechanisms
    - Handles settlement and transfer of ownership

3. **Offset Project Contract:** Manages and tracks carbon offset projects
    - Registers new carbon offset projects
    - Tracks project lifecycle and milestones
    - Monitors offset verification and validation
    - Connects real-world data with on-chain representation

4. **Compliance Contract:** Ensures adherence to emissions regulations
    - Implements regulatory frameworks from different jurisdictions
    - Tracks corporate and individual carbon footprints
    - Verifies compliance with reduction commitments
    - Provides audit-ready reporting and transparency

## Features

- **Tokenized Carbon Credits:** Each credit represented as a unique token with verifiable attributes
- **Price Transparency:** Real-time market-driven pricing
- **Reduced Counterparty Risk:** Smart contracts enforce trading terms
- **Global Accessibility:** Connect offset projects and buyers worldwide
- **Fraud Prevention:** Immutable recording of credit creation and retirement
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Built-in checks for various carbon market frameworks
- **Automated Verification:** Multi-stage validation process for offset projects
- **Market Analysis:** On-chain data for carbon credit market metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ETH for gas fees
- Verified identity for KYC compliance (for credit issuers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-credit-platform.git
   cd carbon-credit-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Run local development environment
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Deploy to testnet
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

2. Verify contracts on Etherscan
   ```
   npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

## Usage

### For Carbon Credit Generators

1. Register offset project with required documentation
2. Submit for verification and monitoring
3. Receive tokenized carbon credits when milestones are validated
4. List credits on the marketplace or sell directly to buyers

### For Carbon Credit Buyers

1. Browse available carbon credits with full transparency on source projects
2. Purchase credits through auction or fixed-price mechanisms
3. Retire credits to claim offset against emissions
4. Generate compliance reports for regulatory requirements

## Carbon Credit Verification Process

1. **Project Registration:** Offset project details submitted with methodology
2. **Validation:** Third-party validators verify project claims
3. **Monitoring:** Ongoing data collection to confirm carbon sequestration
4. **Verification:** Regular audits to ensure continued compliance
5. **Issuance:** Carbon credits tokenized based on verified offsets
6. **Retirement:** Credits permanently taken out of circulation when used for compliance

## Technical Specifications

- ERC-1155 token standard for fungible carbon credits
- ERC-721 for unique project verification certificates
- Oracle integration for external data verification
- Decentralized storage (IPFS) for project documentation
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced gas fees

## Governance

The platform implements a DAO structure for:
- Approving new carbon credit methodologies
- Updating verification standards
- Managing the validator network
- Allocating resources for platform development

## Roadmap

- **Q3 2023:** Testnet launch with voluntary carbon market
- **Q4 2023:** Mainnet launch with initial project onboarding
- **Q1 2024:** Integration with major compliance markets (EU ETS, etc.)
- **Q2 2024:** Cross-chain bridging for interoperability
- **Q3 2024:** Introduce derivatives and structured carbon products
- **Q4 2024:** Launch governance token and complete DAO transition

## Environmental Impact

This platform aims to accelerate climate action by:
- Increasing market efficiency for carbon credits
- Reducing entry barriers for high-quality offset projects
- Improving trust and transparency in carbon markets
- Enabling broader participation in emissions reduction
